This reportory contains the "UCI HAR Dataset" files and "run_Analysis.R", "Codebook.md", "data.processed.txt" and "README_CourseProject.md"

The "UCI HAR Dataset" files are all those files downloaded from the course project in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course

The "run_Analysis.R" is the program script that used to analyse the raw data from the "UCI HAR Dataset". By placing this file into the workding directory of the "UCI HAR Dataset" and run the it, the script will generate a txt file called "data.processed.txt" in the same working directory. 

The "CodeBook.md" is the code book for the "data.processed.txt" dataset. It contain the variable names and the method to generate the dataset. 

The "data.processed.txt" is the processed tidy data set.

The "README_CourseProject.md" is the file you are reading right now, self-explained. Although I really don't know how should I write this file and the CodeBook. Rip >_<
